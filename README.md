    <h1>Light – Reflection and
        Refraction</h1></div>
        <div class="c">
    <p>We see a variety of objects in the world around us. However, we are
        unable to see anything in a dark room. On lighting up the room,
        things become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, the
        sunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it.
        This reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things.
        We are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmitted
        through it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena
        associated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling
        of stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium
        and so on. A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.
        By observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may
        conclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small
        source of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this
        straight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.</p> 
        
        <p>In this Chapter, we shall study the phenomena of reflection and
            refraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic
            concepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in
            nature. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the reflection of light
            by spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real
            life situations.</p></div>

            <h3>10.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT</h3></div>

            <p>A highly polished surface, such as a mirror, reflects most of the light
                falling on it. You are already familiar with the laws of reflection of light.Let us recall these laws –
                (i) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and
                (ii) The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence
                and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.
                These laws of reflection are applicable to all types of reflecting surfaces
                including spherical surfaces. You are familiar with the formation of image
                by a plane mirror. What are the properties of the image? Image formed
                by a plane mirror is always virtual and erect. The size of the image is
                equal to that of the object. The image formed is as far behind the mirror
                as the object is in front of it. Further, the image is laterally inverted.
                How would the images be when the reflecting surfaces are curved? Let
                us explore.The curved surface of a shining spoon could be considered as a curved
                mirror. The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical
                mirror. The reflecting surface of such mirrors can be considered to form
                a part of the surface of a sphere. Such mirrors, whose reflecting surfaces
                are spherical, are called spherical mirrors. We shall now study about
                spherical mirrors in some detail.</p>
                <div class="f">
                <h3>10.2 SPHERICAL MIRRORS</h3></div>
                <p>The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or
                    outwards. A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards,
                    that is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.
                    A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called
                    a convex mirror. The schematic representation of these mirrors is shown
                    in Fig. 10.1. You may note in these diagrams that the back
                    of the mirror is shaded.
                    You may now understand that the surface of the spoon
                    curved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror
                    and the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be
                    approximated to a convex mirror.
                    Before we move further on spherical mirrors, we need to
                    recognise and understand the meaning of a few terms. These
                    terms are commonly used in discussions about spherical
                    mirrors. The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical
                    mirror is a point called the pole. It lies on the surface of the
                    mirror. The pole is usually represented by the letter P.The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere.
                    This sphere has a centre. This point is called the centre of curvature of
                    the spherical mirror. It is represented by the letter C. Please note that the
                    centre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting
                    surface. The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.
                    However, it lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror. You may
                    note this in Fig.10.2 (a) and (b). The radius of the sphere of which the
                    reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius
                    of curvature of the mirror. It is represented by the letter R. You may note
                    that the distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. Imagine a straight
                    line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical
                    mirror. This line is called the principal axis. Remember that principal
                    axis is normal to the mirror at its pole. Let us understand an important
                    term related to mirrors, through an Activity.</p>

                        <p>The paper at first begins to burn producing smoke. Eventually it
                            may even catch fire. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is converged
        at a point, as a sharp, bright spot by the mirror. In fact, this spot of light
        is the image of the Sun on the sheet of paper. This point is
        the focus of the concave mirror. The heat produced due to
        the concentration of sunlight ignites the paper. The distance
        of this image from the position of the mirror gives the
        approximate value of focal length of the mirror.
        Let us try to understand this observation with the help
        of a ray diagram.
        Observe Fig.10.2 (a) closely. A number of rays parallel
        to the principal axis are falling on a concave mirror. Observe
        the reflected rays. They are all meeting/intersecting at a
        point on the principal axis of the mirror. This point is called
        the principal focus of the concave mirror. Similarly, observe
        Fig. 10.2 (b). How are the rays parallel to the principal axis,
        reflected by a convex mirror? The reflected rays appear to
        come from a point on the principal axis. This point is called
        the principal focus of the convex mirror. The principal focus
        is represented by the letter F. The distance between the
        pole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called
        the focal length. It is represented by the letter f.
        
        The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is by-and-large spherical.
        The surface, then, has a circular outline. The diameter of the reflecting
        surface of spherical mirror is called its aperture. In Fig.10.2, distance
        MN represents the aperture. We shall consider in our discussion only
        such spherical mirrors whose aperture is much smaller than its radius
        of curvature.
        Is there a relationship between the radius of curvature R, and focal
        length f, of a spherical mirror? For spherical mirrors of small apertures,
        the radius of curvature is found to be equal to twice the focal length. We
        put this as R = 2f . This implies that the principal focus of a spherical
        mirror lies midway between the pole and centre of curvature</p>

        <h2>10.2.1 Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors</h2></div>

        <p>You have studied about the image formation by plane mirrors. You also
            know the nature, position and relative size of the images formed by them.
            How about the images formed by spherical mirrors? How can we locate
            the image formed by a concave mirror for different positions of the object?
            Are the images real or virtual? Are they enlarged, diminished or have
            the same size? We shall explore this with an Activity.You will see in the above Activity that the nature, position and size of
            the image formed by a concave mirror depends on the position of the
            object in relation to points P, F and C. The image formed is real for some
            positions of the object. It is found to be a virtual image for a certain other
            position. The image is either magnified, reduced or has the same size,
            depending on the position of the object. A summary of these observations
            is given for your reference in Table 10.1.</p>

            <div class="h">
            <h2>10.2.2 Representation of Images Formed by Spherical
                Mirrors Using Ray Diagrams</h2></div>
                <p>We can also study the formation of images by spherical mirrors by
                    drawing ray diagrams. Consider an extended object, of finite size, placed
                    in front of a spherical mirror. Each small portion of the extended object
                    acts like a point source. An infinite number of rays originate from each
                    of these points. To construct the ray diagrams, in order to locate the
                    image of an object, an arbitrarily large number of rays emanating from a
                    point could be considered. However, it is more convenient to consider
                    only two rays, for the sake of clarity of the ray diagram. These rays are
                    so chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the
                    mirror.
                    The intersection of at least two reflected rays give the position of image
                    of the point object. Any two of the following rays can be considered for
                    locating the image. (i) A ray parallel to the
                    principal axis, after
                    reflection, will pass through
                    the principal focus in case of
                    a concave mirror or appear
                    to diverge from the principal
                    focus in case of a convex
                    mirror. This is illustrated in
                    Fig.10.3 (a) and (b). (a) (b)
                    FigureFigure Figure 10.310.3 10.3
                    Light – Reflection and Refraction 165
                    (ii) A ray passing through the
                    principal focus of a concave
                    mirror or a ray which is
                    directed towards the
                    principal focus of a convex
                    mirror, after reflection, will
                    emerge parallel to the
                    principal axis. This is
                    illustrated in Fig.10.4 (a)
                    and (b).
                    (iii) A ray passing through the
                    centre of curvature of a
                    concave mirror or directed
                    in the direction of the centre
                    of curvature of a convex
                    mirror, after reflection, is
                    reflected back along the
                    same path. This is
                    illustrated in Fig.10.5 (a)
                    and (b). The light rays come
                    back along the same path
                    because the incident rays
                    fall on the mirror along the
                    normal to the reflecting
                    surface.
                    (iv) A ray incident obliquely to
                    the principal axis, towards
                    a point P (pole of the mirror),
                    on the concave mirror
                    [Fig. 10.6 (a)] or a convex
                    mirror [Fig. 10.6 (b)], is
                    reflected obliquely. The
                    incident and reflected rays
                    follow the laws of reflection
                    at the point of incidence
                    (point P), making equal
                    angles with the principal axis.
                    (a) (b)
                    Figure 10.4
                    Remember that in all the above cases the laws of reflection are followed.
                    At the point of incidence, the incident ray is reflected in such a way that
                    the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.
                    (a) Image formation by Concave Mirror
                    Figure 10.7 illustrates the ray diagrams for the formation of image
                    by a concave mirror for various positions of the object</p>

                    <h2>Uses of concave mirrors</h2></div>
                    <p>Concave mirrors are commonly used in torches, search-lights and
                        vehicles headlights to get powerful parallel beams of light. They are
                        often used as shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face. The
                        dentists use concave mirrors to see large images of the teeth of patients.
                        Large concave mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to produce
                        heat in solar furnaces.</p>

                        <p>We studied the image formation by a concave mirror. Now we shall
                            study the formation of image by a convex mirror. We consider two positions of the object for studying the image formed
                            by a convex mirror. First is when the object is at infinity and the second
                            position is when the object is at a finite distance from the mirror. The ray
                            diagrams for the formation of image by a convex mirror for these two
                            positions of the object are shown in Fig.10.8 (a) and (b), respectively.
                            The results are summarised in Table 10.2You have so far studied the image formation by a plane mirror, a
                            concave mirror and a convex mirror. Which of these mirrors will give the
                            full image of a large object? Let us explore through an Activity.You can see a full-length image of a tall building/tree in a small
                            convex mirror. One such mirror is fitted in a wall of Agra Fort facing Taj
                            Mahal. If you visit the Agra Fort, try to observe the full image of Taj
                            Mahal. To view distinctly, you should stand suitably at the terrace

                            <h3>Uses of convex mirrors</h3></div>
                            <p>Convex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view (wing) mirrors in
                                vehicles. These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the
                                driver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convex
                                mirrors are preferred because they always give an erect, though
                                diminished, image. Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved
                                outwards. Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view much larger
                                area than would be possible with a plane mirror.</p>

                                pWhile dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors, we shall
                                follow a set of sign conventions called the New Cartesian Sign
                                Convention. In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as the
                                origin (Fig. 10.9). The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis
                                (X’X) of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows –
                                (i) The object is always placed to the left of the mirror. This implies
                                that the light from the object falls on the mirror from the left-hand
                                side.
                                (ii) All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the
                                pole of the mirror.
                                (iii) All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along
                                + x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of
                                the origin (along – x-axis) are taken as negative.
                                (iv) Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis
                                (along + y-axis) are taken as positive.
                                (v) Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis
                                (along –y-axis) are taken as negative.The New Cartesian Sign Convention described above is illustrated in
                                Fig.10.9 for your reference. These sign conventions are applied to obtain
                                the mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.

                                <h3>10.2.4 Mirror Formula and Magnification</h3></div>
                                <p>In a spherical mirror, the distance of the
                                    object from its pole is called the object
                                    distance (u). The distance of the image from
                                    the pole of the mirror is called the image
                                    distance (v). You already know that the
                                    distance of the principal focus from the pole
                                    is called the focal length (f). There is a
                                    relationship between these three quantities
                                    given by the mirror formula which is
                                    expressed as
                                    1/v + 1/u = 1/f
                                    
                                
                                    This formula is valid in all situations for all
                                    spherical mirrors for all positions of the
                                    object. You must use the New Cartesian Sign
                                    Convention while substituting numerical
                                    values for u, v, f, and R in the mirror formula

                                    <p>Magnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to
                                        which the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.
                                        It is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the
                                        object. It is usually represented by the letter m.......
